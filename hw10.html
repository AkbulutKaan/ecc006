        <section id="conclusions" class="conclusion">
            <h2>Comments and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>According to the survey results, all participants have experience with online shopping. This indicates the high prevalence of e-commerce adoption within this group. It is particularly observed that the young population aged 18-25 and individuals with university-level education (either current students or graduates) are highly engaged in online shopping. The frequency of monthly and weekly purchases suggests that online platforms are used regularly by the majority of participants. Trendyol's clear lead among favorite shopping sites may reflect strong local market dynamics and user preferences in the surveyed region. The higher number of female participants compared to male participants reflects the gender distribution of this specific sample group and could be a pointer for broader research into gender preferences in online shopping if a more representative sample were used.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The young and educated demographic in this sample extensively uses e-commerce.</li>
                <li>The frequency of online shopping is quite high, with most participants shopping monthly or weekly.</li>
                <li>Local e-commerce platforms (like Trendyol) are very popular among this group.</li>
            </ul>
