        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed pt-2">
          The primary goal in <strong>PUBG: Battlegrounds</strong> is simple yet thrilling: survive and outlast everyone else to be the last player or team standing. Each match starts with up to 100 players parachuting onto a vast and open battleground, where no two rounds are ever the same. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed pt-2">
          Once on the ground, players must scavenge for weapons, armor, healing items, and vehicles, all while keeping an eye on opponents and the ever-shrinking safe zone. Known as the “blue zone,” this circle gradually contracts over time, pushing players closer together and forcing confrontations. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed pt-2">
          <strong>Strategic positioning</strong>, <strong>resource management</strong>, and <strong>precision shooting</strong> play crucial roles as the match progresses. Every decision—from where to land, when to move, and how to engage enemies—can mean the difference between an early exit and claiming the famous "Winner Winner Chicken Dinner."

This critical early decision can determine access to loot, safety, and strategic positioning. Choosing a remote area offers safety, while contested zones promise better loot but higher risk.">

Proper looting ensures survival during initial encounters and gives a competitive edge later. Experienced players know where to find the best loot and how to prioritize quickly under pressure.">

Those caught outside take increasing damage, which adds urgency and unpredictability to each phase. Navigating the zone becomes a game of risk vs. reward, especially during endgame circles.">
