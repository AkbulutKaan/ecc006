        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed pt-2">
          The primary goal in <strong>League of Legends</strong> is to destroy the opposing team's <strong>Nexus</strong> — the central structure within their base — while defending your own. The Nexus is protected by multiple layers of defenses, including towers, inhibitors, and waves of enemy minions.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed pt-2">
          Each team consists of five unique champions selected from a pool of over 160, categorized into roles such as Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, and Support. These roles work together across three lanes and a jungle to gain advantages in gold, experience, and map control.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed pt-2">
          Players push through enemy structures, secure map objectives (such as Dragons, Rift Heralds, and Baron Nashor), and engage in team fights to create windows of opportunity. <strong>Macro strategy</strong>, <strong>individual mechanical skill</strong>, and <strong>coordinated teamwork</strong> are essential in executing successful plays.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed pt-2">
          The game ends when a team successfully destroys the enemy Nexus, signaling total victory in the match.

        <div class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed space-y-4 pt-2">
          <p><strong>League of Legends</strong>, often abbreviated as <strong>LoL</strong>, is a competitive, team-based multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) developed by <strong>Riot Games</strong>. Since its release in <strong>2009</strong>, the game has evolved into one of the most played and influential titles in the world.</p>
          <p>LoL matches take place on a symmetrical battlefield called <strong>Summoner’s Rift</strong>, where two teams of five players fight to outmaneuver and outplay each other using powerful champions. Each champion features a distinct playstyle, ability kit, and strategic role — making champion mastery and team composition essential.</p>
          <p>The game is known for its strategic depth, fast-paced mechanics, and constantly shifting meta. Players must balance individual performance (microplay) with big-picture planning (macroplay), including lane pressure, ward control, vision denial, and objective management.</p>
          <p>With regular patches, seasonal updates, new champion releases, and rotating game modes, League of Legends remains fresh and exciting year-round. The addition of cinematic events, in-game lore, and partnerships with music and media projects (like <strong>K/DA</strong> or <strong>Arcane</strong>) have expanded the game into a global brand.</p>
          <p>Its global esports presence is unmatched, with professional leagues like the <strong>LCS</strong>, <strong>LEC</strong>, <strong>LCK</strong>, and <strong>LPL</strong> feeding into the annual <strong>World Championship</strong>, watched by millions of fans worldwide.</p>
          <p>League of Legends is more than just a game — it’s a constantly evolving world, a competitive arena, and a cultural movement that connects players across the globe.</p>
