        <div class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed space-y-4 pt-2">
          <p>In <strong>Warframe</strong>, players step into the role of the Tenno — ancient warriors awakened from centuries of cryosleep, equipped with biomechanical suits known as Warframes. These suits grant extraordinary agility, strength, and abilities, making the Tenno powerful agents of balance in a fractured solar system.</p>
          <p>The core objective is to complete a wide variety of missions spread across the Origin System. These missions include everything from high-stakes assassinations and stealthy sabotage operations to large-scale defense and survival missions. Players progress through the Star Chart by unlocking new planets, gaining access to powerful blueprints, and unraveling the game's mysterious lore through cinematic quests.</p>
          <p>As a predominantly <strong>Player vs. Environment (PvE)</strong> experience, Warframe emphasizes cooperative play, exploration, and mastery over a constantly expanding universe. With new factions, enemies, and mission types continuously introduced, the game provides a sense of ongoing progression and purpose.</p>

        <div class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed space-y-4 pt-2">
          <p><strong>Warframe</strong> is a free-to-play, third-person action game developed by <strong>Digital Extremes</strong>. First launched in 2013, the game has undergone tremendous evolution, now offering a rich sci-fi universe filled with deep lore, large open-world zones, and complex character customization.</p>
          <p>What sets Warframe apart is its fluid and high-speed combat system. Players seamlessly blend acrobatics, gunplay, and melee combat through a parkour-driven movement system that allows wall-running, sliding, and aerial strikes. Each Warframe has its own unique abilities, providing a variety of playstyles — from stealth assassins and crowd-control specialists to aggressive tanks and support healers.</p>
          <p>The game is well-regarded for its generous monetization model, allowing players to earn almost every item through gameplay. Dozens of Warframes, hundreds of weapons, and a wide array of cosmetics and companions are all obtainable without needing to spend real money. This system has cultivated a loyal, active community that supports the game’s continued development.</p>
          <p>With ongoing updates, story-driven cinematic quests like “The Second Dream” and “The New War,” and a commitment to transparency by its developers, Warframe continues to thrive as one of the most ambitious and player-focused live-service games in the industry.</p>
